    My project is iheardyouharvard.com. I Heard You Harvard is a site for people to share funny 
comments (anonymously) that they hear around Harvard campus—be they odd, humorous, disturbing, 
out of context, or all four. 

From the homepage of iheardyouharvard.com, users can access via clicking the menu bar:
-	Submit a Story: here users will find text boxes to record the title of their story, 
    the location where they heard it, a pseudonym for themselves (often a funny phrase), and the story itself. 
-	Statistics (coming soon): Users can see statistics in a pie chart. Currently in the making 
    is a pie chart showing the breakdown of the writers’ years in school (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, other).
-	Popular: this feature ranks the posts on the website in order of the highest total amount of votes 
    for the given post (including both upvotes and downvotes).
-	Log In/Log Out: users can choose to register and log in to the site. If the user is currently logged in,
    this link will display Log Out.
-	My Account: see features below.
-	Contact Us: Here users can submit a quick form to send an email to the website’s administrator.

For the user's My Account page (once logged in):
-	Submit a Story: same form as above, except now that the user is logged in, the website will store 
    the post with the user’s unique id for access in the Your Posts section later.
-	Your Posts: this is a history of a user’s posts that were submitted while the user was logged in.
-	Favorites: this is perhaps one of the coolest features of the site. Users have the ability to 
    mark posts in the Homepage and Your Posts as favorites, and then when the users view Favorites within 
    My Account, they will see a record of the posts the have marked as favorites.
-	Change Password: Not happy with your previous password? Afraid someone is going to hack your 
    anonymous account? For whatever reason, users can change their password here.
-	Log Out: self-explanatory.

    As far as the Homepage (and Your Posts and Favorites pages), users are able to vote on stories—but a given 
user is allowed just one upvote and one downvote per story (design explained in the design document). The way 
I implemented this, I did not have to deal with IP addresses or cookies to ensure that one user never gets 
to vote twice in the same direction.

    There are also links to other entertaining online Harvard websites, like Harvard FML, I Saw You Harvard, 
cs50, and even one secret link (try it out for yourself!). These are in the footer of the page, for anyone who 
wants “more harvard.”
